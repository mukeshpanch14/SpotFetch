# SpotFetch

We all love Windows 10 SpotLight Images. This application will make you save all the SpotLight Images within your local Folders. All we need to do is to place the Shortcut of the .exe file into the Startup Folder. Then for every single startup instance it will refresh your folders with beautiful images. 

This application will create a folder in location "C:/Users/<your user name>/SpotFetch"
  You can get all images for laptop(1920x1080) is "C:/Users/<your user name>/SpotFetch/Laptop" and for Mobile(1080x1920) is         "C:/Users/<your user name>/SpotFetch/Phone"
  
This is made using Python3
